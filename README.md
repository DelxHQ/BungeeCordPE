 # What is this?
 BungeeCordPE is a port from a BungeeCord which allows transfering players to multiple servers...ect)
 But features will be limited due to some packets being changed in MCPE. But again it will mainly be for
 BukkitPE and should not be used in any "Custom MCPE Server Softwares" no exceptions. :)
